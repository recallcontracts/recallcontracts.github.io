         <p class="section-text">
            Nowadays, contracts has an important role in business where trade relationships between different parties are dictated by legal rules.
            The concept of electronic contracts has arisen mostly due to technological advances and most frequent practice of electronic trading between companies and customers.
            Therewith new challenges have emerged to guarantee reliability between the stakeholders in the electronic negotiations.
            The automatic verification of electronic contracts has arisen as a new challenge  especially in the task of detecting conflicts in multi-party contracts.
            The problem of checking contracts has been largely addressed in the literature, but only few works have dealt with multi-party contracts.
            The RECALL tool is an automatic checker for finding conflicts on multi-party contracts modeled by the relativized contract language.
            The modeling and automatic checking of the contract  allow us to ascertain important results on its business model.
